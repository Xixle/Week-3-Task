# Week-3-Task

## Task :
```
Create a pom.xml in your repository (choosing a Maven project in IntelliJ should automatically do this for you), and add the dependency for Hibernate â€“ org.hibernate:hibernate-core:<version>. Find a way to test your new dependency.

Add ORM mapping for your local database from last week, test and ensure that you can access, add, change and delete records in your database through Hibernate.

Push the code to your remote repository.
